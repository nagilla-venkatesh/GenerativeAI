"""
Every night between 7 pm and midnight, two computing jobs from two different sources are randomly started with each one lasting an hour.

Unfortunately, when the jobs simultaneously run, they cause a failure in some of the companyâ€™s other nightly jobs, resulting in downtime for the company that costs $1000. 

The CEO, who has enough time today to hear one word, needs a single number representing the annual (365 days) cost of this problem.

Note: Write a function to simulate this problem and output an estimated cost 

Bonus - How would you solve this using probability?
