--Weâ€™re given a table of product purchases. Each row in the table represents an individual user product purchase.

--Write a query to get the number of customers that were upsold, or in other words, the number of users who bought additional products after their first purchase.

--Note: If the customer purchased two things on the same day, that does not count as an upsell, as they were purchased within a similar timeframe.

--Example:

--Input:

--transactions table

--Column	Type
--id	INTEGER
--user_id	INTEGER
--created_at	DATETIME
--product_id	INTEGER
--quantity	INTEGER

--Output:

--Column	Type
--num_of_upsold_customers	INTEGER

SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_upsold_customers
FROM (
	SELECT user_id
	FROM transactions
	GROUP BY user_id
	HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(created_at)) > 1
) as t
